# About me

I am Dani, a Software Engineer living in Barcelona specialised in the Web's Frontend since I finished Multimedia degree at the university.

I have worked with vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript, early versions of Angular in the past, with React for more than 7 years, and I am currently learning Vue.js (version 3). Furthermore, I've been developing by my own using Vue.js for about a year and I have not a commercial project with this framework (yet).

My most relevant commercial projects are:

- **Be12 Suite**: A first-class security software suite for businesses under Swiss law protection. I was in charge of the frontend of the different applications, such as an encrypted data bank, email and a chat. There were also dashboards showing application metrics. The main focus of this project was about encryption and decryption using different security algorithms.

- **Marmota e-commerce**: The first e-commerce by a relevant mattresses and rest utensils brand from Catalunya. I was in charge of migrating from Twig templates to SPA React application and adapt theming to the specific client. The main focus of this project was performance and big traffic as well as multiple metrics systems due to the aggressive campaigns (TV ads i.e.) the brand did. 

- **Alicorp marketplace**: The first digital marketplace for a very relevant brand in America, specifically Per√∫. I was in charge of architecting the main applications, the Storefront, made using Next.js, where the client will buy items, and the Backoffice, made using base React, where the owners will manage their stores. The main focus of this project was also performance and big traffic, but also scalability as it became a software as a service product.

I've been working into other projects, fintech related, travel management, etc.
